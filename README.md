## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this project to practice the content of HTML and CSS that I had been learning. My code may not be as neat and clean or very Accessible, however I am proud of this as this is my very first project that I worked on with minimal help.

### Continued development

There are many things that I want to build upon. But the main two are:
- Flex-box
- CSS Grids

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools CSS Grid Layout](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - I used this as a reference to my CSS Grid code. Very quick and easy.
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - This is where I learned HTML and CSS. A very excellent website with tons of tutorials for programming.
- [Smashing Magazine Media Queries](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/media-queries-responsive-design-2018/) - Helped me understand Media Queries to convert webpages into mobile-friendly pages.
